		<p>Hello random person!  I don't know how you found this random and useless website, but you did.  Anyway, now on to some random colors!:)</p>
		<u>This coding is hard!  I hope you apreciate this hard coding work I am doing!</u>
		<br><font color ="green">GREEN</font>
		<br><font color ="yellow">YELLOW</font>  Wow, that yellow is hard to read!
		<br><font color ="purple">PURPLE</font>
		<br><font color ="pink">PINK</font><br><font color ="blue">BLUE</font>
		<br><font color ="orange">ORANGE</font>
		<p>Enough with the colors.  I really am just wasting space, aren't I?  By the way, I am making paragraphs.  You are probably getting pretty bored.  It's okay, I don't blame you.  You can get off now if you want.  Seriously.  Don't you have BETTER things to do?  If you don't go, I'll assume you want to keep reading junk.  I'll give you three seconds to leave.  3...2...1  I WARNED YOU!</p>
